But here's the problem most founders face: they don't know where to start, how much it'll cost, or how to choose the right development partner. In this guide, we break down everything you need to know about working with an MVP development company — from real cost numbers to the exact tech stack we recommend at Kunamix.",

            "body": "An MVP — Minimum Viable Product — is the simplest version of your product that solves one core problem for your target user. It's not a half-baked product. It's a strategic first version designed to validate your idea with real users before you invest heavily in full development.\n\nHere's why it matters:\n\nMost startups fail not because of bad ideas — but because they build too much, too soon. They spend 12 months and $30,000+ building a product that nobody wants. An MVP forces you to answer the most important question first: Will people actually use this?\n\nWith a well-built MVP, you can launch in 6–8 weeks, get real user feedback, attract early investors, and iterate based on data — not assumptions. That's the difference between a startup that survives and one that burns out before finding product-market fit."

            "body": "One of the biggest advantages of working with Kunamix is cost-efficiency without compromising quality. Here's a realistic cost breakdown based on MVP type:\n\n**Simple Web App MVP (e.g., SaaS dashboard, booking platform)**\n- Timeline: 4–6 weeks\n- Cost: $1,800 – $5,000 (₹1.5L – ₹4L)\n- Includes: UI/UX design, frontend, backend API, database, basic auth\n\n**Mobile App MVP (Android or iOS)**\n- Timeline: 6–10 weeks\n- Cost: $3,500 – $10,000 (₹3L – ₹8L)\n- Includes: React Native/Flutter app, REST API backend, push notifications, admin panel\n\n**Full-Stack Product MVP (Web + Mobile + Admin)**\n- Timeline: 8–14 weeks\n- Cost: $7,000 – $18,000 (₹6L – ₹15L)\n- Includes: Everything above + cloud deployment, analytics, CMS\n\n**What affects the cost?**\nThe number of features you insist on including in v1 is the #1 cost driver. Every feature you defer to v2 saves you 20–30% in development time and cost. A good MVP development partner will push back on feature creep — that's a sign they respect your budget.\n\nAt Kunamix, we always start with a feature prioritization session before writing a single line of code. It saves our clients an average of $1,500–$2,500 in unnecessary early development."

            "body": "Choosing the wrong tech stack is one of the most expensive mistakes a startup can make. Rebuilding your entire backend at scale because your original stack couldn't handle growth is a nightmare — and it happens more than you think.\n\nHere's what we recommend at Kunamix for most MVP builds in 2026:\n\n**Frontend: Next.js (React)**\nWhy: Fast, SEO-friendly, supports both static and dynamic pages, massive ecosystem. Perfect for web-based MVPs.\n\n**Backend: Node.js + Express**\nWhy: JavaScript across the stack means faster development, easy to find developers, handles real-time features well.\n\n**Database: PostgreSQL**\nWhy: Reliable, scalable, supports complex queries. Better than MongoDB for most structured data use cases.\n\n**Mobile: React Native or Flutter**\nWhy: One codebase for Android and iOS. React Native if your web team uses React. Flutter if you need the best native-like performance.\n\n**ORM: Prisma**\nWhy: Clean, type-safe database access. Reduces bugs significantly.\n\n**Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + AWS or Railway (backend)**\nWhy: Vercel deployments are instant. AWS gives you room to scale without migrating later.\n\nThis stack is what powers most modern SaaS products globally. It's battle-tested, has strong community support, and will comfortably scale from 0 to 100,000 users without a full rewrite."

            "body": "There are thousands of dev shops globally. Most will take your money and deliver average results. Here's how to separate the good from the rest:\n\n**1. Check their actual code, not just their portfolio website**\nAsk for a GitHub link or code sample. Any serious dev company should have public repos or be willing to share sanitized code samples. This tells you more than any case study.\n\n**2. Do they have UI/UX capability in-house?**\nMany dev companies outsource design — which creates communication gaps and delays. Your MVP needs design and development working together from day one.\n\n**3. How do they handle feature scope?**\nIf a company just says 'yes' to everything you ask for — run. A good technical partner will challenge your feature list and help you cut it down to what truly matters for v1.\n\n**4. What does their communication look like?**\nYou should get weekly progress updates, access to a staging environment, and a clear Git workflow. If they can't explain their process clearly, their code will reflect that.\n\n**5. Do they offer post-launch support?**\nLaunching is not the finish line. Bugs happen. Users find edge cases. Make sure your partner offers at least 30–60 days of post-launch support.\n\nAt Kunamix, we include all of the above as standard — not as an upsell."

Every feature we build has a reason behind it.\n\n**Modern stack, clean code.** React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Flutter. No legacy frameworks. No spaghetti code. Full documentation delivered with every project.\n\n**Transparent pricing, no surprises.** We scope every project with a detailed technical estimate before you commit to anything. What we quote is what you pay.\n\n**Real projects delivered.** We've built ERP systems, café management platforms, hospital software, quiz platforms, and SaaS dashboards. Our GitHub shows the work.\n\nWe're not the biggest company in the room. We're the most invested one. Every client we take on gets our full attention — because we only work with founders we genuinely believe in.\n\nIf you're serious about building your MVP the right way, we'd love to talk."

Your team lives in Excel sheets**\nIf your operations manager tracks inventory in a spreadsheet, your accountant reconciles data in another sheet, and your sales team manages leads in a third — your business is running on guesswork. One wrong formula, one deleted row, one outdated file — and you're flying blind.\n\n**2. You can't see your business clearly in real time**\nWhen a business owner can't answer 'What's our stock level right now?' or 'Which customers haven't paid in 30 days?' without calling three people — that's a data problem. And data problems cost money, always.\n\n**3. You're manually doing things that should be automatic**\nSending payment reminders manually. Updating purchase orders by hand. Generating invoices one by one. If your team spends hours per week on tasks a system could do in seconds, your labour cost is being wasted on low-value work.\n\n**4. You can't scale without chaos**\nYour current process works for your current volume. But what happens when you double your orders, add a new location, or onboard 10 more staff? If the honest answer is 'it breaks down' — you need a system that scales with you.\n\n**5. You've outgrown your current software**\nYou started with a basic tool when the business was small. Now it's becoming a bottleneck. Limitations in reporting, user access, integrations, or workflows are slowing your team down every single day."

You own it. You control it. You can modify it as your business evolves.\n\n**SaaS vs Custom ERP — The Real Comparison:**\n\n- Ownership: SaaS = rented tool | Custom = your asset\n- Customisation: SaaS = limited | Custom = built for your exact workflow\n- Cost over 3 years: SaaS subscriptions often cost MORE than a custom build\n- Data control: SaaS = stored on their servers | Custom = your infrastructure\n- Scalability: SaaS = their roadmap | Custom = your priorities"

You're never locked in or forced to rebuild.\n\n**'What if our team isn't technical?'**\nThat's exactly who we build for. Our interfaces are designed for operational teams — not engineers. We provide training, documentation, and ongoing support. If your staff can use WhatsApp, they can use your ERP.\n\n**'How is this different from hiring a freelancer?'**\nA freelancer is one person. If they go offline, your project stalls. We're a five-person team with developers, a designer, and a project manager. We follow Git-based workflows, write clean documented code, and provide a warranty on everything we build.\n\n**'What does it actually cost?'**\nWe don't believe in opaque pricing.

Instead of saying no, you bring in a partner who specialises in exactly that.\n\n**3. Margin protection**\nA senior developer in London or New York costs $60–$100/hour.

You're chasing updates at 11pm. Stand-up calls get cancelled. Promises are made and quietly dropped.\n\n**No accountability when things go wrong.**\nA freelancer disappears. An offshore agency says the scope changed. The NDA wasn't airtight. Suddenly your client's data, design assets, and IP are unprotected.\n\nThe problem isn't India.

You see exactly what was built, what's in progress, and what's next — without chasing.\n\n**✅ Defined communication windows**\nA good Indian development partner offers overlapping hours with UK/US time zones — typically 9am–1pm GMT or EST. Daily async updates via Slack or email. No radio silence.\n\n**✅ A real team — not a solo freelancer**\nIf one person is your entire development partner, you are one personal emergency away from a missed deadline.

A typical web application project — 10 weeks of development, React frontend + Node.js backend + admin dashboard.\n\n**Option 1: Hire in-house (UK)**\n- Senior developer salary: £65,000/year\n- Employer NI + benefits: ~£10,000/year\n- Time to hire: 4–8 weeks\n- For a 10-week project: ~£14,000 + hiring cost + onboarding risk\n\n**Option 2: Hire a freelancer**\n- Rate: £400–£600/day in UK\n- 10 weeks (50 days): £20,000–£30,000\n- Risk: availability, quality, continuity\n\n**Option 3: White Label with Kunamix**\n- Fixed project pricing\n- Typical equivalent project: $5,000–$12,000\n- Includes: design, development, testing, deployment, documentation\n- No hiring cost. No employment overhead. No continuity risk.\n\nThe math isn't close. And the risk profile is far better — because you have a team, a process, and accountability, not a single point of failure."

            "body": "Most agencies make one of two mistakes when outsourcing: they rush in without due diligence, or they overthink it and never start.\n\nHere's a simple framework to start right:\n\n**Step 1: Start with a small, low-risk project**\nDon't hand over your most important client's project first. Give the partner a contained internal project or a smaller client project. See how they communicate, how they handle blockers, and what their code quality actually looks like.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the process, not just the output**\nAnyone can show you a nice portfolio. What you're actually buying is their process. Are they proactive? Do they flag issues before they become problems? Do they ask the right questions at the start?\n\n**Step 3: Lock down the legal framework early**\nNDA. IP assignment clause. Confidentiality terms. These should be signed before you share a single wireframe or brief. A professional partner will have these ready — you shouldn't need to ask.\n\n**Step 4: Define communication expectations upfront**\nHow often will you get updates? Which timezone hours overlap? What's the escalation path if something goes wrong? Get this in writing before the project starts.\n\n**Step 5: Review the codebase before final payment**\nBefore you pay the final invoice — have a technical review of the code. Check for documentation, version control history, and test coverage. A partner who delivers clean, documented code is a partner worth keeping long-term."

            "body": "**'Will my clients find out you exist?'**\nNo. We operate entirely in the background. No Kunamix branding, no direct client communication, no mentions in code comments or documentation. From your client's perspective, your agency built everything.\n\n**'What if the project is late?'**\nWe manage this proactively. If a sprint is at risk of slipping, we tell you in advance — not after. We'd rather have an uncomfortable conversation early than surprise you on a deadline. In our process, you always know exactly where the project stands.\n\n**'Can we work on ongoing retainer?'**\nYes — and this is how our best agency relationships work. A monthly retainer gives you guaranteed capacity, priority scheduling, and a team that already knows your stack and standards. We offer flexible retainer models from 20 hours/month upward.\n\n**'What happens to the code if we stop working together?'**\nYou keep everything. The repository is under your GitHub account from day one. All documentation is yours. There's no lock-in, no proprietary systems, no dependency on us to keep your product running.\n\n**'How do we handle time zone differences?'**\nWe offer overlap windows with UK time (9am–2pm GMT) and US East Coast time (10am–3pm EST). Daily async updates via Slack. Weekly live calls via Zoom or Google Meet. Most agency partners tell us our communication is better than developers they've worked with locally."

        "conclusion": "The agencies winning right now aren't necessarily the ones with the biggest in-house teams. They're the ones who've figured out how to deliver more, faster, without proportionally increasing their costs or risk. A white label development partner in India — the right one — is how they're doing it. Not because it's a shortcut. Because it's a smarter way to build. At Kunamix, we've built our entire operation around being the kind of technical partner an agency can trust quietly, long-term, and without second-guessing. If that's what you're looking for, let's talk.",
