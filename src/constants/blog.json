But here's the problem most founders face: they don't know where to start, how much it'll cost, or how to choose the right development partner. In this guide, we break down everything you need to know about working with an MVP development company — from real cost numbers to the exact tech stack we recommend at Kunamix.",

            "body": "An MVP — Minimum Viable Product — is the simplest version of your product that solves one core problem for your target user. It's not a half-baked product. It's a strategic first version designed to validate your idea with real users before you invest heavily in full development.\n\nHere's why it matters:\n\nMost startups fail not because of bad ideas — but because they build too much, too soon. They spend 12 months and $30,000+ building a product that nobody wants. An MVP forces you to answer the most important question first: Will people actually use this?\n\nWith a well-built MVP, you can launch in 6–8 weeks, get real user feedback, attract early investors, and iterate based on data — not assumptions. That's the difference between a startup that survives and one that burns out before finding product-market fit."

            "body": "One of the biggest advantages of working with Kunamix is cost-efficiency without compromising quality. Here's a realistic cost breakdown based on MVP type:\n\n**Simple Web App MVP (e.g., SaaS dashboard, booking platform)**\n- Timeline: 4–6 weeks\n- Cost: $1,800 – $5,000 (₹1.5L – ₹4L)\n- Includes: UI/UX design, frontend, backend API, database, basic auth\n\n**Mobile App MVP (Android or iOS)**\n- Timeline: 6–10 weeks\n- Cost: $3,500 – $10,000 (₹3L – ₹8L)\n- Includes: React Native/Flutter app, REST API backend, push notifications, admin panel\n\n**Full-Stack Product MVP (Web + Mobile + Admin)**\n- Timeline: 8–14 weeks\n- Cost: $7,000 – $18,000 (₹6L – ₹15L)\n- Includes: Everything above + cloud deployment, analytics, CMS\n\n**What affects the cost?**\nThe number of features you insist on including in v1 is the #1 cost driver. Every feature you defer to v2 saves you 20–30% in development time and cost. A good MVP development partner will push back on feature creep — that's a sign they respect your budget.\n\nAt Kunamix, we always start with a feature prioritization session before writing a single line of code. It saves our clients an average of $1,500–$2,500 in unnecessary early development."

            "body": "Choosing the wrong tech stack is one of the most expensive mistakes a startup can make. Rebuilding your entire backend at scale because your original stack couldn't handle growth is a nightmare — and it happens more than you think.\n\nHere's what we recommend at Kunamix for most MVP builds in 2026:\n\n**Frontend: Next.js (React)**\nWhy: Fast, SEO-friendly, supports both static and dynamic pages, massive ecosystem. Perfect for web-based MVPs.\n\n**Backend: Node.js + Express**\nWhy: JavaScript across the stack means faster development, easy to find developers, handles real-time features well.\n\n**Database: PostgreSQL**\nWhy: Reliable, scalable, supports complex queries. Better than MongoDB for most structured data use cases.\n\n**Mobile: React Native or Flutter**\nWhy: One codebase for Android and iOS. React Native if your web team uses React. Flutter if you need the best native-like performance.\n\n**ORM: Prisma**\nWhy: Clean, type-safe database access. Reduces bugs significantly.\n\n**Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + AWS or Railway (backend)**\nWhy: Vercel deployments are instant. AWS gives you room to scale without migrating later.\n\nThis stack is what powers most modern SaaS products globally. It's battle-tested, has strong community support, and will comfortably scale from 0 to 100,000 users without a full rewrite."

            "heading": "How to Choose the Right MVP Development Company",
            "body": "There are thousands of dev shops globally. Most will take your money and deliver average results. Here's how to separate the good from the rest:\n\n**1. Check their actual code, not just their portfolio website**\nAsk for a GitHub link or code sample. Any serious dev company should have public repos or be willing to share sanitized code samples. This tells you more than any case study.\n\n**2. Do they have UI/UX capability in-house?**\nMany dev companies outsource design — which creates communication gaps and delays. Your MVP needs design and development working together from day one.\n\n**3. How do they handle feature scope?**\nIf a company just says 'yes' to everything you ask for — run. A good technical partner will challenge your feature list and help you cut it down to what truly matters for v1.\n\n**4. What does their communication look like?**\nYou should get weekly progress updates, access to a staging environment, and a clear Git workflow. If they can't explain their process clearly, their code will reflect that.\n\n**5. Do they offer post-launch support?**\nLaunching is not the finish line. Bugs happen. Users find edge cases. Make sure your partner offers at least 30–60 days of post-launch support.\n\nAt Kunamix, we include all of the above as standard — not as an upsell."

Every feature we build has a reason behind it.\n\n**Modern stack, clean code.** React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Flutter. No legacy frameworks. No spaghetti code. Full documentation delivered with every project.\n\n**Transparent pricing, no surprises.** We scope every project with a detailed technical estimate before you commit to anything. What we quote is what you pay.\n\n**Real projects delivered.** We've built ERP systems, café management platforms, hospital software, quiz platforms, and SaaS dashboards. Our GitHub shows the work.\n\nWe're not the biggest company in the room. We're the most invested one. Every client we take on gets our full attention — because we only work with founders we genuinely believe in.\n\nIf you're serious about building your MVP the right way, we'd love to talk."

Your team lives in Excel sheets**\nIf your operations manager tracks inventory in a spreadsheet, your accountant reconciles data in another sheet, and your sales team manages leads in a third — your business is running on guesswork. One wrong formula, one deleted row, one outdated file — and you're flying blind.\n\n**2. You can't see your business clearly in real time**\nWhen a business owner can't answer 'What's our stock level right now?' or 'Which customers haven't paid in 30 days?' without calling three people — that's a data problem. And data problems cost money, always.\n\n**3. You're manually doing things that should be automatic**\nSending payment reminders manually. Updating purchase orders by hand. Generating invoices one by one. If your team spends hours per week on tasks a system could do in seconds, your labour cost is being wasted on low-value work.\n\n**4. You can't scale without chaos**\nYour current process works for your current volume. But what happens when you double your orders, add a new location, or onboard 10 more staff? If the honest answer is 'it breaks down' — you need a system that scales with you.\n\n**5. You've outgrown your current software**\nYou started with a basic tool when the business was small. Now it's becoming a bottleneck. Limitations in reporting, user access, integrations, or workflows are slowing your team down every single day."

You own it. You control it. You can modify it as your business evolves.\n\n**SaaS vs Custom ERP — The Real Comparison:**\n\n- Ownership: SaaS = rented tool | Custom = your asset\n- Customisation: SaaS = limited | Custom = built for your exact workflow\n- Cost over 3 years: SaaS subscriptions often cost MORE than a custom build\n- Data control: SaaS = stored on their servers | Custom = your infrastructure\n- Scalability: SaaS = their roadmap | Custom = your priorities"

You see real progress every 2 weeks — not a finished product 6 months later.\n\n5. **Testing & Deployment** — Thorough QA, UAT with your team, cloud deployment (AWS/Vercel), and a smooth go-live.\n\n6. **Ongoing Support** — Bug fixes, feature additions, and technical support — we're your long-term tech partner, not a one-time vendor.\n\nAverage delivery time: 6–12 weeks depending on complexity.

Start with your core operations. Add CRM, analytics, or integrations as you grow. You're never locked in or forced to rebuild.\n\n**'What if our team isn't technical?'**\nThat's exactly who we build for. Our interfaces are designed for operational teams — not engineers. We provide training, documentation, and ongoing support. If your staff can use WhatsApp, they can use your ERP.\n\n**'How is this different from hiring a freelancer?'**\nA freelancer is one person. If they go offline, your project stalls. We're a five-person team with developers, a designer, and a project manager. We follow Git-based workflows, write clean documented code, and provide a warranty on everything we build.\n\n**'What does it actually cost?'**\nWe don't believe in opaque pricing. Most SMB ERPs from Kunamix range between $3,000 and $10,000 depending on the number of modules, users, and integrations.
