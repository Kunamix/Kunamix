        "intro": "You have an idea. You've validated it with a few potential users. Now you need to build it — fast, lean, and without burning your entire budget. That's exactly what an MVP is for. But here's the problem most founders face: they don't know where to start, how much it'll cost, or how to choose the right development partner. In this guide, we break down everything you need to know about working with an MVP development company in India — from real cost numbers to the exact tech stack we recommend at Kunamix.",

            "body": "An MVP — Minimum Viable Product — is the simplest version of your product that solves one core problem for your target user. It's not a half-baked product. It's a strategic first version designed to validate your idea with real users before you invest heavily in full development.\n\nHere's why it matters:\n\nMost startups fail not because of bad ideas — but because they build too much, too soon. They spend 12 months and ₹30 lakhs building a product that nobody wants. An MVP forces you to answer the most important question first: Will people actually use this?\n\nWith a well-built MVP, you can launch in 6–8 weeks, get real user feedback, attract early investors, and iterate based on data — not assumptions. That's the difference between a startup that survives and one that burns out before finding product-market fit."

            "heading": "Real MVP Development Cost in India: A Honest Breakdown",
            "body": "One of the biggest reasons founders come to India for MVP development is cost. But 'affordable' doesn't mean cheap — it means better value for the same quality.\n\nHere's a realistic cost breakdown based on MVP type:\n\n**Simple Web App MVP (e.g., SaaS dashboard, booking platform)**\n- Timeline: 4–6 weeks\n- Cost: ₹1.5L – ₹4L\n- Includes: UI/UX design, frontend, backend API, database, basic auth\n\n**Mobile App MVP (Android or iOS)**\n- Timeline: 6–10 weeks\n- Cost: ₹3L – ₹8L\n- Includes: React Native/Flutter app, REST API backend, push notifications, admin panel\n\n**Full-Stack Product MVP (Web + Mobile + Admin)**\n- Timeline: 8–14 weeks\n- Cost: ₹6L – ₹15L\n- Includes: Everything above + cloud deployment, analytics, CMS\n\n**What affects the cost?**\nThe number of features you insist on including in v1 is the #1 cost driver. Every feature you defer to v2 saves you 20–30% in development time and cost. A good MVP development partner will push back on feature creep — that's a sign they respect your budget.\n\nAt Kunamix, we always start with a feature prioritization session before writing a single line of code. It saves our clients an average of ₹1–2L in unnecessary early development."

            "id": "tech-stack",
            "heading": "The Best Tech Stack for Your MVP in 2025",
            "body": "Choosing the wrong tech stack is one of the most expensive mistakes a startup can make. Rebuilding your entire backend at scale because your original stack couldn't handle growth is a nightmare — and it happens more than you think.\n\nHere's what we recommend at Kunamix for most MVP builds in 2025:\n\n**Frontend: Next.js (React)**\nWhy: Fast, SEO-friendly, supports both static and dynamic pages, massive ecosystem. Perfect for web-based MVPs.\n\n**Backend: Node.js + Express**\nWhy: JavaScript across the stack means faster development, easy to find developers, handles real-time features well.\n\n**Database: PostgreSQL**\nWhy: Reliable, scalable, supports complex queries. Better than MongoDB for most structured data use cases.\n\n**Mobile: React Native or Flutter**\nWhy: One codebase for Android and iOS. React Native if your web team uses React. Flutter if you need the best native-like performance.\n\n**ORM: Prisma**\nWhy: Clean, type-safe database access. Reduces bugs significantly.\n\n**Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + AWS or Railway (backend)**\nWhy: Vercel deployments are instant. AWS gives you room to scale without migrating later.\n\nThis stack is what powers most modern SaaS products globally. It's battle-tested, has strong community support, and will comfortably scale from 0 to 100,000 users without a full rewrite."

            "heading": "How to Choose the Right MVP Development Company in India",
            "body": "There are thousands of dev shops in India. Most will take your money and deliver average results. Here's how to separate the good from the rest:\n\n**1. Check their actual code, not just their portfolio website**\nAsk for a GitHub link or code sample. Any serious dev company should have public repos or be willing to share sanitized code samples. This tells you more than any case study.\n\n**2. Do they have UI/UX capability in-house?**\nMany dev companies outsource design — which creates communication gaps and delays. Your MVP needs design and development working together from day one.\n\n**3. How do they handle feature scope?**\nIf a company just says 'yes' to everything you ask for — run. A good technical partner will challenge your feature list and help you cut it down to what truly matters for v1.\n\n**4. What does their communication look like?**\nYou should get weekly progress updates, access to a staging environment, and a clear Git workflow. If they can't explain their process clearly, their code will reflect that.\n\n**5. Do they offer post-launch support?**\nLaunching is not the finish line. Bugs happen. Users find edge cases. Make sure your partner offers at least 30–60 days of post-launch support.\n\nAt Kunamix, we include all of the above as standard — not as an upsell."

Every feature we build has a reason behind it.\n\n**Modern stack, clean code.** React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Flutter. No legacy frameworks. No spaghetti code. Full documentation delivered with every project.\n\n**Transparent pricing, no surprises.** We scope every project with a detailed technical estimate before you commit to anything. What we quote is what you pay.\n\n**Real projects delivered.** We've built ERP systems, café management platforms, hospital software, quiz platforms, and SaaS dashboards. Our GitHub shows the work.\n\nWe're not the biggest company in the room. We're the most invested one. Every client we take on gets our full attention — because we only work with founders we genuinely believe in.\n\nIf you're serious about building your MVP the right way, we'd love to talk."

        "conclusion": "Building an MVP in India gives you a massive cost and speed advantage — but only if you choose the right development partner. The wrong company will give you a slow, unscalable product that costs twice as much to fix as it did to build. The right partner will challenge your assumptions, protect your budget, and deliver a product your users actually want to use. That's what we do at Kunamix.",
